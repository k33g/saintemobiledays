#Backbone

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

##This is a model

    define([
        'backbone'
    ], function(Backbone){

      var Article = Backbone.Model.extend({
            defaults : {
              title : "My Life",
              author : "@k33g_org",
                content : "..."
            }
          //, urlRoot : "/articles"
      });

      return Article;
    });
