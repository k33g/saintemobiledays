#Golo - a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM.

The world didn't need another JVM language.
So we built yet another one. A simple one.

Golo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language that favours explicit over implicit. You should become a Golo programmer within hours, not days.


    function Book = -> DynamicObject()
      :mixin(Model())
      :mixin(MongoModel(Mongo(): database("golodb"): collection("books")))

    function Books = -> DynamicObject()
      :mixin(Collection())
      :mixin(MongoCollection(Book()))
